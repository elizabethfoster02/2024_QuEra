    "QuEra's neutral atom quantum computer is uniquely suited to finding the maximum independent set (MIS) of a unit disk (UD) graph. In this case, unit disk graphs are those generated by placing a series of nodes or points on a 2d plane, drawing circles of equal radius around them, and connecting the nodes which are within each other's circles via edges or lines. A maximum independent set is a set containing the maximum possible number of points, where no two points in the set are within each other's disks. One can think of creating an MIS like trying to paint as many nodes on the graph as possible such that no two connected nodes are both painted. A square lattice is one for which a node exists on "
